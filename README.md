# OnchainWallets Communication Assets Repository

Welcome to the OnchainWallets Assets Repository. This repository contains logos, email images, and third-party illustrations used for OnchainWallets projects.

## Repository Structure
- **`onchain/`**: Contains proprietary logos and email images created by OnchainWallets. These are protected by copyright and subject to the usage policy outlined in `USAGE.md`.
- **`third-party/`**: Contains third-party images organized by source in subfolders (e.g., `third-party/storyset/` for Storyset images). Files in these subfolders, such as those with a `st_` prefix (e.g., `st_hero-illustration.svg`), are subject to their respective provider’s terms and attribution requirements, detailed in `attributions.md`.

## Usage Policy

- **Third-Party Assets** (in `third-party/`): These are governed by the original provider’s terms (e.g., Storyset’s Terms of Use: https://storyset.com/terms). You are responsible for complying with these terms, including attribution requirements. See `attributions.md` for details.

## Attributions
Third-party assets, such as those in the `third-party/` folder, require attribution unless otherwise specified. For example: "Illustration by Storyset (https://storyset.com/)". Full attribution details and source links are provided in `attributions.md`.
